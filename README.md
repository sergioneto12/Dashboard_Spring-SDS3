# Sells Dashboard To Get The Most Of It!

The project you are close to see is a masterpiece of everything you want to see about full stack application.

## The backend

The project was made around the use of Spring, getting the Java Languague behind it all, using some construtor to the data pagination.
Although the project uses Postgres (and here we assume it needs a lot of SQL codes), Spring gets us all of date, only giving us the job "copy" and "paste" the codes. Simples as that!

The usability is large, but it can get tense if you change any letter between the codes!

## The frontend

As shown by the programming, the "Spring 'React' Week" uses React framework!

But not only that, the code, done in Typescript (better to watch errors!) uses some good packages behind it: Axios (and we love that!), apexcharts (if you don't know this, better get some docs, it's a lot useful!), date-fns (I live in Brasil, needs my local time, or you need yours!) and bootstrap to be a little faster to get things beautiful (maybe, it'll be changed later!)

I assume you don't want to clone, and make all that stuff to see it running, hum?
So get this link, you can see both front and backend in action at final app: https://sellingdashboard.netlify.app/

### The deploy

The backend was deployed at Heroku. The server page got all tools it needed to connect the database in Spring.

The frontend was deployed at Netlify. You, it's very simple there, but could be used elsewhere, too!
